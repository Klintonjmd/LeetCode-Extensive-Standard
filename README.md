# LeetCode-Comprehensive-Standard

This repo is intended to be a comprehensive assembly of leetcode problems, answers, and documentation.

I plan to include all of my answers in python for leetcode problems here, discussing the time complexity, the methods used, and 
my thought process when looking at the problem, and while actually coding it out.

# Structure
Problems will be divided up by their respective algorthim / data structure solution.

1. Problem Link
2. Problem Description and Difficulty
3. First Thoughts and Constraints
4. My First Solution and Time Complexity
5. Optimal Solution and Time Complexity
6. Final Thoughts
7. Subsequent Attempts and Revisions
