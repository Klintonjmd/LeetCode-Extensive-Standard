    Learned about the p element, but people usually use div I think
    and when you add an enter in the div text it does not put you in
    a new line on the webpage

    Basic CSS & Applied Visual Design
  </h1>
  <div>
    Here I plan on talking about some of the basic CSS that is used on this
    site as well as demonstrate some simple things you can do with CSS. At
    this point, our CSS is stored in the same document as our HTML but
    eventually I plan on learing how to move it out.
  </div>
  <div style="color: lightgray;">
    This div has a style customizer that changes the text color to light gray.
    Although the h2 class is not used, it has a style modifier that changes it
    to be red.
  </div>
  <div class="red-text" style="font-size: 12px;"">
    This div has the red-text class. Multiple elements can share the same class.
    This element also has a modified font size which was done inline. It has a
    font size of 12px. Also included in the red text class is a font family, 
    Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif. This is to ensure that the correct font or
    fallback font is displayed. Fonts can also be imported like as shown above 
    although I will not be importing any for this site.
  </div>

    </a>
    <div id="example-id">
      Above this, we are shown an image that incoroporates some CSS modifiers using
      a CSS class. You can set the id of different elemets. This div's id is
      "example-id". These id's take precedent over classes. Each element should
      have a unique id. This div's id make the text italic. This image has a boder
      with modified style, color, width, and radius.
    </div>
    <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: rgb(8, 24, 37);" tabindex="0">
      In this and some of the following divs, we will look at padding, borders,
      and margins. This div has a padding of 10px using inline css styles. It
      also has a slightly different background color to demonstrate the padding.
      An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element's
      content and its border. An element's margin controls the amount of space
      between an element's border and surrounding elements. If you set an
      element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.
    </div>
    <div style="margin: 10px">
      This div has a margin of 10px. The margin does not cosnist of the altered
      background color like the padding did. You also can set margins to be
      negative values. An element's padding controls the amount of space
      between the element's content and its border. An element's margin controls
      the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.
      If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow
      larger.
    </div>
    <div style="padding: 20px 0px 20px 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: snow;">
      This div has padding only on the top and bottom. You can select attribute
      types like "radio" for example when styling your webpage. This is done
      above with the radio buttons. Notice how the text runs all the way to the
      edges on the left and right.
    </div>
    <div>
      When styling elements, there are two types of units: relative and absolute.
      The last several challenges all set an element's margin or padding with
      pixels (px). Pixels are a type of length unit, which is what tells the
      browser how to size or space an item. In addition to px, CSS has a number
      of different length unit options that you can use. The two main types of
      length units are absolute and relative. Absolute units tie to physical units
      of length. For example, in and mm refer to inches and millimeters,
      respectively. Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a
      screen, but there are some differences depending on a screen's resolution.
      Relative units, such as em or rem, are relative to another length value. For
      example, em is based on the size of an element's font. If you use it to set
      the font-size property itself, it's relative to the parent's font-size. Note:
      There are several relative unit options that are tied to the size of the
      viewport. They are covered in the Responsive Web Design Principles section.
    </div>
    <div>
      Styles can be inherieted from the body element. They can also be overridden
      by other style designations. In order of greatest to least priority is:
      "!important", inline styles, ID attributes, class declarations, subsequent
      CSS, and finally, body elements. There is also a z-index which determines
      which layers are ontop or below other layers.

      Applied Accessibility
    </h1>
    <div>
      It is important to ensure that images have an alternative description for text
      readers and those who are visually impaired. Alt texts are not neccessary when
      the image already has an included caption or is used only for decoration. It is
      also important to ensure you are usng the proper headings in your html file in
      order to ensure that the website is semantically correct and easy to follow.
      There are important content headers (main, header, footer) that are used to
      divide up a website properly and make it easier to access important content.
    </div>
    <div>
      An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically 
      related content. They can be used within each other, as needed. For example, if 
      a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. When there's no 
      relationship between groups of content, then use a div.
      <div>
        div - groups content --
        section - groups related content --
        article - groups independent, self-contained content
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      The next HTML5 element that adds semantic meaning and improves accessibility is 
      the header tag. It's used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for 
      its parent tag and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple 
      pages. header shares the embedded landmark feature you saw with main, allowing 
      assistive technologies to quickly navigate to that content. The nav element is 
      another HTML5 item with the embedded landmark feature for easy screen reader 
      navigation. This tag is meant to wrap around the main navigation links in your page.
    </div>
    <div>
      Similar to header and nav, the footer element has a built-in landmark feature that 
      allows assistive devices to quickly navigate to it. It's primarily used to contain 
      copyright information or links to related documents that usually sit at the bottom 
      of a page.
    </div>
    <div>
      HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream 
      content in your markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible 
      to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the 
      page or a link to a transcript. The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This 
      shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard 
      functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its 
      presence on the tag turns the setting on.
      <audio id="meowClip" controls>
        <source src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/screen-reader.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

    </div>
    <div>
      Make Elements Only Visible to a Screen Reader by Using Custom CSS<br>
      the "<.br>" tag (no period) creates a break in the paragraph text. You can make
        elements visible only to a screen reader. An example of some screen-reader friendly
        css rules are:<br>
        .sr-only {<br>
          position: absolute;<br>
          left: -10000px;<br>
          width: 1px;<br>
          height: 1px;<br>
          top: auto;<br>
          overflow: hidden;<br>
        } <br>
        using display: none or width:0px. height:0px removes the element from the flow of the
        document, causing screen recorders to ignore it.
    </div>
    <div>
      You want your text to be at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast level with the backgrouud to
      promote good readability. It's also important to make sure that imporatnt information
      on your sight is demonstrated not only via color but also through size and image.
      Finally, make sure that hyperlinks are descriptive so the site reader knows what it
      links to.
    </div>
    <div>
      HTML offers the accesskey attribute to specify a shortcut key to activate or bring focus 
      to an element. Adding an accesskey attribute can make navigation more efficient for 
      keyboard-only users. <br>
      HTML5 allows this attribute to be used on any element, but it's particularly useful when 
      it's used with interactive ones. This includes links, buttons, and form controls.
    </div>
    <div>
      The HTML tabindex attribute has three distinct functions relating to an element's keyboard 
      focus. When it's on a tag, it indicates that the element can be focused on. The value (an 
      integer that's positive, negative, or zero) determines the behavior. <br>
      Certain elements, such as links and form controls, automatically receive keyboard focus 
      when a user tabs through a page. It's in the same order as the elements come in the HTML 
      source markup. This same functionality can be given to other elements, such as div, span, 
      and p, by placing a tabindex="0" attribute on them. <br>
      The tabindex attribute also specifies the exact tab order of elements. This is achieved 
      when the attribute's value is set to a positive number of 1 or higher. <br>
      Setting a tabindex="1" will bring keyboard focus to that element first. Then it cycles 
      through the sequence of specified tabindex values (2, 3, etc.), before moving to default 
      and tabindex="0" items.
    </div>
    <div>
      Media Queries are a new technique introduced in CSS3 that change the presentation of 
      content based on different viewport sizes. The viewport is a user's visible area of a 
      web page, and is different depending on the device used to access the site. <br>
      Media Queries consist of a media type, and if that media type matches the type of 
      device the document is displayed on, the styles are applied. You can have as many 
      selectors and styles inside your media query as you want. <br>
      The following article has a media query that the font size is changed when viewed on a
      device with a max heigh less than or equal to 800px. It is left alligned, light gray
      text.
    </div>
    <p>
      Media Query Example

    <div>
      Making images responsive with CSS is actually very simple. You just need to add these 
      properties to an image: max-width: 100%; height: auto; <br>
      The max-width of 100% will make sure the image is never wider than the container it is 
      in, and the height of auto will make the image keep its original aspect ratio.
    </div>
    <div>
      The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High-Resolution Displays, such as 
      the MacBook Pros "retina display" is to define their width and height values as only half of 
      what the original file is. The following image has that property
    </div>
    <img id="retina-image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/FCCStickers-CamperBot200x200.jpg" 
    alt="freeCodeCamp sticker that says 'Because CamperBot Cares'">
    <div>
      There are four different viewport units: <br>
      vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width. <br>
      vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height. <br>
      vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension 
      (height or width). <br>
      vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension 
      (height or width). <br>
      The following div has an id that sets its viewport maximum to 80%.
    </div>
    <div id="viewport-example">
      This div takes up only 80% of the viewports larger dimension (height or width). When the 
      preview window is shrunk, you can see that the right end of the div goes out of view.
    </div>
    <h1>
      CSS Flexbox
    </h1>
    <div display: flex;>
      Adding display: flex to an element turns it into a flex container. This makes it possible 
      to align any children of that element into rows or columns. You do this by adding the 
      flex-direction property to the parent item and setting it to row or column. Creating a row 
      will align the children horizontally, and creating a column will align the children 
      vertically. <br>
